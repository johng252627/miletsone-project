# Jonner's Gym

This website provides information about Jonner's Gym for both new and existing members.

The website was designed to be an easily accessible, straight-forward tool for 
new members to sign up, providing information on why it is worthwhile to apply
for a membership at the gym, with clear membership options with distinct benefits.

By having a simple joining process and readily available informtion regarding contact
information, location, opening hours and schedules of classes, new members will
be encouraged to join the gym and increase the gym's clientele.

## UX

This website is for new members who are looking for a way to change their lifestyle habits
and get more exercise.

The main goal of the website is to attract new members. As such, the main focus of the 
site is on the membership offers, which are displayed prominently on the home page.
Links to join the gym from the home page are easily accessible and are coloured 
brightly in order to help facilitate the joining process.

Information about the gym's opening hours, location and contact details, and social
media links are displayed in the footer so that the user has easy access to this information
on all pages within the website. The header also contains links to the sign up page and 
classes page, as well as to the home page, which further eases accessibility for 
users.

The schedule for the gym's classes is also available, with a page dedicated to it in 
order to make it clear what is on offer. Because membership offers reduced rates for 
the classes it is important to have these displayed. And by having classes run at 
different times throughout the day new members will be able to find a routine that will
suit their lifestyle.

Images of equipment and people exercising are also displayed throughout the website.
This aims to reinforce the message of a healthy lifestyle through fitness and encourages
the user to join the gym.

Displaying the information across three pages was chosen as it will not overload the user 
with too much information at one time. By keeping it in separate, bite-size parts the 
user - especially a new user - can fully absorb what is being presented. This also 
aids clarity throughout the website, as the relevant information can be found on it's own
through links provided in the header, or in the footer.

Keeping the header and footer the same throughout the website creates a sense of unity and
continuity throughout. It also makes the website more visually appealing and balanced.
This helps to reduce any cognitive load and allows the user to focus on the content of the
page, without being distracted. By focusing on the content the user is guided towards joining
the gym, thereby fulfilling the goal of the website.

A simple, clean and uncluttered aesthetic was chosen. Again, this is to keep the impact of 
the cognitive load low on the user and provide a sense of space, reminiscent of the large, 
open spaces within a gym, such as the pilates studio. 

Strong and clean colours were also chosen to provide contrast between the header and footer 
and the main content of each page. This allows the user to unconsciously navigate the different 
sections.

The specific images were chosen as they represent a diverse range of activites and equipment. 
This provides visual insight into what the gym has to offer it's clients as well as possible 
inspiration to users looking to improve their health and achieve their fitness goals.

### User Stories

As a person who wants to improve my fitness:

1. I am dissatisfied with my current fitness level and want to improve it.
2. I am looking for a gym that offers a wide range of facilities and assistance to people
with little knowledge on how to achieve their fitness goals.
3. I want to be able to join a gym without having to have prior knowledge about specific 
classes or exercise techniques.
4. Having all classes available to me at a reduced rate would allow me to try multiple
exercises until I find one that suits me.
5. I want a simple sign-up method that is quick, where I am aware of exaclty what benefits
I'm receiving.

As a person who wants to change gyms:

1. I want a gym that provides more one-to-one training.
2. I want the flexibility to attend classes that suit my schedule.
3. I want a gym with long opening hours throughout the week so that I can avoid peak 
times when necessary so I don't have to wait for equipment to be free.
4. I want a gym that has a wide variety of equipment so that I can train in different ways.

### Wireframes

During the planning and development process I created some wireframes to get an idea of how
the project would look and to let me plan the structure of the website.

This was also helpful in that I could keep the layout in mind while writing the code so 
I knew what I was doing at each stage.

To access the wireframes, follow these links:

[Sign up page](wireframes/wireframes-join.pdf)

## Features

### Existing Features

Each page has a header, footer and main section.

The header has the name of the gym, which links to the home page. It also has navigation
links to the home, classes and sign up pages.

The footer has information about the opening hours, contact and location information and
links to the gym's social media.

Home page

* There are images showing pictures of people exercising and the gym equipment.
* There is a paragraph of text providing information about the gym.
* There is information about the membership offers with an opaque background
to draw the eye of the users.
* There are buttons that link to the sign up page so users have another way
of quickly accessing this.

Classes

* There are more images to motivate users to exercise.
* There is a paragraph of text motivating users to explore the classes.
* The schedules for different classes are displayed, which includes what the classes
are and the times they are on.

Sign up

* There are more images that aim to inspire users to join the gym.
* There is a paragraph of text encouraging users to sign up.
* There is an sign up form that gives the users a choice of membership type.

### Features Still To Impleament

There are a number of features that I would like to implement in the future.
Some of the possibilities for future inclusion are:

* Gallery of photos on a carousel loop.
* Members area with access to exclusive training programmes.
* Members testimonials.

## Technologies Used

[HTML](https://html.com/)
*This project uses HTML for the core structure of the website.

[CSS](https://www.w3.org/)
*CSS was used to style the elements within the website.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
*Bootstrap was used to create the navbar, sign up form and for the grid system structure.

## Testing

Checked code using these validators via direct input to identify and correct errors.

### Testing User Stories

For a person who wants to improve their fitness:

1. I am dissatisfied with my current fitness level and want to improve it.

The website provides motivation, both through text and images to encourage the user to achieve
this goal, as well as providing a first step towards doing so.

2. I am looking for a gym that offers a wide range of facilities and assistance to people
with little knowledge on how to achieve their fitness goals.

The site has information showing the range of classes available, as well as showing their 
are personal training sessions to guide people with little previous knowledge.

3. I want to be able to join a gym without having to have prior knowledge about specific 
classes or exercise techniques.

Again, by having personal training available through membership and personal fitness plans
being created for each member, the user can be confident that they do need to know what they 
are doing before they arrive.

4. Having all classes available to me at a reduced rate would allow me to try multiple
exercises until I find one that suits me.

Displaying information regarding the membership rates and that there are discounts available for 
classes allows the user to achieve this. By having different classes running at different times 
throughout the week it provides the user with flexibility.

5. I want a simple sign-up method that is quick, where I am aware of exaclty what benefits
I'm receiving.

The sign-up method is clear and concise. There are multiple ways of accessing the sign-up page.

For a person who wants to change gyms:

1. I want a gym that provides more one-to-one training.

The membership offers clearly display the number of personal training sessions available
on a monthly basis.

2. I want the flexibility to attend classes that suit my schedule.

The classes page shows the times that classes are scheduled for and that multiple ones
are available for each class every week.

3. I want a gym with long opening hours throughout the week so that I can avoid peak 
times when necessary so I don't have to wait for equipment to be free.

The opening hours are displayed in the footer of each page so the user always has easy
access and can decide if the hours are long enough.

4. I want a gym that has a wide variety of equipment so that I can train in different ways.

The images troughout the website show a range of equipment available at the gym.


I have tested that the links in the navigation bar all work for each page for screens of
various sizes:
* Click on each link.
* Check that it brings to desired page.
* Change screen size through inspect tool.
* Check if toggler is working.
* Check if links are working in toggler form.

Following this, I checked the links in the footer on each page:
* Click on each link and verify it opens in a new window.
* Verify that the links lead to the correct social media website.
* Verify they are working on every page within the website.

Then, I checked the links to the sign-up form from index.html membership offers:
* Click the links and verify they lead to signup.html.

I also checked the signup form:
* Fill out form but with invalid email address format and verify error appears.
* Fill out form but leave password out and verify that error appears.

The website seems to look well on devices of different sizes. On smaller devices, various elements -
such as images that would take up too much space - are not displayed. Other elements are moved below
each other to display the information in a less crowded and more aesthetically pleasing manner.

An issue that I have still not solved is making sure the passwords in the sign-up form match.
I have tried using the required tag and looking up solutions but I have not yet discovered what 
will work correctly. This is something that I would like to work on in the future.

Another issue is that when the sign-up form is filled out, the submit button takes the user to an error
page. I tried making this button a link to the home page, but this then always took the user to the home
page when clicked, rather than showing the user if there was an error in what they had entered in the form.
Again, this is something that I would like to continue to research so that I can find a solution.

## Credits

### Content
I obtained code from [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for styling. I used it for 
the CDN in the head, as well as the navbar, for the grid sytem throughout the main section
and in the footer.

I also used Bootstrap for the sign-up form.

I obtained some code from [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) in order to get the images 
to display without the porportions appearing vertically stretched from [here.](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11757537/css-image-size-how-to-fill-but-not-stretch)

I used [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for icons.

I also used [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts used in this project.

### Acknowledgements 

For this project, I received inspiration from the Code Institute "Whiskey Drop" project for the navbar
toggler idea.

I also received inspiration for using the bootstrap grid system from the Code Institute "Rosie Odenkirk"
project.

Furthermore, I received aid from the Code Institute Tutors when I could not get my toggler to work correctly,
they provided guidance that allowed me to complete the section.

Finally, by reading through similar problems on Stack Overflow and documentation on Bootstrap I was able to solve
many of the issues I was having with this project.
