# Jonner's Gym

This website provides information about Jonner's Gym for both new and existing members.

The website was designed to be an easily accessible, straight-forward tool for 
new members to sign up, providing information on why it is worthwhile to apply
for a membership at the gym, with clear membership options with distinct benefits.

By having a simple joining process and readily available informtion regarding contact
information, location, opening hours and schedules of classes, new members will
be encouraged to join the gym and increase the gym's clientele.

## UX

This website is for new members who are looking for a way to change their lifestyle habits
and get more exercise.

The main goal of the website is to attract new members. As such, the main focus of the 
site is on the membership offers, which are displayed prominently on the home page.
Links to join the gym from the home page are easily accessible and are coloured 
brightly in order to help facilitate the joining process.

Information about the gym's opening hours, location and contact details, and social
media links are displayed in the footer so that the user has easy access to this information
on all pages within the website. The header also contains links to the sign up page and 
classes page, as well as to the home page, which further eases accessibility for 
users.

The schedule for the gym's classes is also available, with a page dedicated to it in 
order to make it clear what is on offer. Because membership offers reduced rates for 
the classes it is important to have these displayed. And by having classes run at 
different times throughout the day new members will be able to find a routine that will
suit their lifestyle.

Images of equipment and people exercising are also displayed throughout the website.
This aims to reinforce the message of a healthy lifestyle through fitness and encourages
the user to join the gym.

Displaying the information across three pages was chosen as it will not overload the user 
with too much information at one time. By keeping it in separate, bite-size parts the 
user - especially a new user - can fully absorb what is being presented. This also 
aids clarity throughout the website, as the relevant information can be found on it's own
through links provided in the header, or in the footer.

Keeping the header and footer the same throughout the website creates a sense of unity and
continuity throughout. It also makes the website more visually appealing and balanced.
This helps to reduce any cognitive load and allows the user to focus on the content of the
page, without being distracted. By focusing on the content the user is guided towards joining
the gym, thereby fulfilling the goal of the website.

A simple, clean and uncluttered aesthetic was chosen. Again, this is to keep the impact of 
the cognitive load low on the user and provide a sense of space, reminiscent of the large, 
open spaces within a gym, such as the pilates studio. 

Strong and clean colours were also chosen to provide contrast between the header and footer 
and the main content of each page. This allows the user to unconsciously navigate the different 
sections.

The specific images were chosen as they represent a diverse range of activites and equipment. 
This provides visual insight into what the gym has to offer it's clients as well as possible 
inspiration to users looking to improve their health and achieve their fitness goals.
